In this first post, I thought I would lay out some of my goals- for this blog, for things I want to improve in and for life in general. I don't expect anyone to read this so I thought it'd be a liberating way for me to untangle everything floating around in my head. Right now I'm just finishing my third year as a computer science major at NYU. I really love aspects of it but I still can't see myself as just a "CS person". One of things I like the most about CS is how transferrable it is to other disciplines, so hopefully I can bring a bit of it into other areas I explore. What areas? Right now, I mainly want to focus on these three skills

1. **Web design/development** - get good enough to help others make websites in a way that represents who they are and what they create/love
2. **Digital design** - know software and myself well enough to make interesting work
3. **Drawing** - currently working on improving anatomy; I also want to work on capturing facial expressions and emotions in my drawings

Ideally, I would be able to incorporate some of my other interests into this journey - music, skateboarding, Japanese culture, calligraphy, etc. - but I don't want to overthink too much. The most important thing is to just 'do'! Hopefully this blog holds me a bit more accountable. 

さようなら, Jack.
