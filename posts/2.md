I did a little sketching today, focusing mostly on creating strong lines that are singular strokes. Reading manga (One Piece) and looking at people like Albrecht Durer's work has definitely influenced this, since neither Oda or Durer rely at all on shading to create detail. All of the power comes from lines, far away and close together, evoking clothing draping on the body, wrinkles on the face, and the curves on our hands. It feels a bit like I'm going backwards, but I that's definitely not a bad thing.

An obvious component of linework is hatching, which I guess counts as shading in a way. I've developed a habit of kind of scribbling shading, where it ends up looking like a repetitive pattern of 'Z's and not very realistic. I've found that just taking the time to draw a bunch of clean lines next to each other results in a suprisingly realistic look. Oda does this super well to add just the right amount of depth to his work.
